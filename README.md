# My Portfolio

This is a webpage to my Portfolio that I will be continuing to add to after every project. It includes a section about me, links to my projects I have built and my contact information. The page is up to accessablity standards and has navigation links to all sections on the page. The webpage is meant to be easy to follow and has pictures with alt text related to my projects.
